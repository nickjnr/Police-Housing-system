Greetings!!!!!
Meet your developer NickDevops.

Refer to my police housing system. I designed this system while in campus as my final year projectðŸ˜‚, 
using php as my main starter pack. 

In order to run it, map the php.index file to source directory in your file path then ensure you have the required php extensions installed on your vscode.
